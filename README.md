My humble addition to Filip Růžička's project about the association of obstruction sleep apnea with subcortical brain volume in early PD.

The [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package was used to create reproducible environment for the project. To set-up R environment for reproduction of our results, run:

```
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```
